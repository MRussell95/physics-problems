# physics-problems
The purpose of this repository is to serve as a collection of my personal worked solutions to interesting problems that I find in various physics textbooks. 
Any solutions that are uploaded here do not constitute an official solutions manual to the associated material and should not be considered as such. Rather, they are my own personal take on the working of a particular problem.
