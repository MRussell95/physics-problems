# physics-problems
My own personal worked solutions to various interesting problems that I find in physics. 
I made this Github so I would have a public place to showcase my solutions to problems that I find in various physics textbooks and other pieces of physics literature.  
Any solutions that are uploaded here do not constitute an official solutions manual to the associated material and should not be considered as such. Rather, they are my own personal take on the working of a particular problem.
